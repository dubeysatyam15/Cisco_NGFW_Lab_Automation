# 🚀 Cisco NGFW Initial Deployment Automation

This project automates the **initial deployment of Cisco Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW)** using a Python script. It simulates a user configuring NGFW via Telnet and automates the basic network setup to help reduce manual overhead during lab preparation.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

During my internship, we identified that customers spent significant time manually setting up basic network objects on Cisco NGFW before lab exercises. To streamline this process, I developed a Python-based automation script that connects via Telnet and performs the initial configuration automatically.
